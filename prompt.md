Did you commit your changes and create a PR?  



You did a great job and now I want to hand the project off to a fresh AI. Please summarize what you did, what stage the project is now in, and what you believe the next step is for a different AI to do.  If there are any tips you would give, include them.  Write this as if it was an AI prompt (no need to create any new files).  Please remind it to avoid any hidden fallbacks.
