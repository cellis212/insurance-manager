# Insurance Manager - Project Status

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Core Game Engine Development

## üéØ Project Overview

The Insurance Manager is an educational simulation game for Risk Management and Insurance (RMI) courses. It features a plugin-based architecture with academic rigor suitable for research while maintaining engaging gameplay.

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues

### Issue #1: Missing Environment Configuration (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `.env` file was missing, preventing backend startup
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive `.env` file with secure defaults
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Backend now loads configuration successfully

### Issue #2: Database Import Inconsistencies (FIXED)  
- **Problem**: API endpoints importing `get_db` instead of `get_session`
- **Solution**: Updated all imports across the codebase systematically
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - FastAPI app loads without import errors

### Issue #3: Pydantic V2 Compatibility (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Using deprecated `orm_mode` instead of `from_attributes`
- **Solution**: Updated Pydantic model configurations to V2 syntax
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - No more Pydantic warnings

## üéØ Next Priorities

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Complete Market Simulation**: Implement BLP demand model integration
2. **Investment Optimization**: Build portfolio optimization with CFO skill effects  
3. **API Endpoints**: Complete decision submission and results endpoints
4. **Basic Frontend**: Authentication and company creation UI

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. **Executive Offices**: Build the main dashboard interface
2. **Decision Forms**: Create turn submission interfaces
3. **Results Display**: Financial reports and turn results
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Playwright

### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. **Advanced Features**: Catastrophe events, regulatory compliance
2. **Performance**: Optimize for 1000+ concurrent players

4. **Polish**: UI/UX improvements and mobile responsiveness

## üìã Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
- Some advanced simulation features are placeholders
- Frontend is basic setup only (no UI components yet)
- Test coverage is minimal (framework in place)

### Technical Debt
- Some JSONB fields could use better schema validation
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Logging system needs structured logging setup

### Architecture Decisions
- Plugin system is designed but not fully utilized yet
- Some complex simulations are simplified for MVP
- Feature flags exist but not fully integrated in UI
