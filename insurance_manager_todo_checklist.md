## Execution Notes

1. Each task should be completed fully before moving to the next
2. Dependencies should be noted when discovered
3. Create feature branches for each major phase
4. Regular commits with descriptive messages
5. Update this checklist as tasks are completed or refined
6. Leverage semester resets to make breaking changes between terms
7. Focus on within-semester stability, between-semester innovation
8. Always implement with future extensibility in mind
9. Document plugin interfaces and extension points
10. Maintain clear separation between core engine and features

**Current Status**: Ready to begin with Phase 1.1 - Project Structure & Dependencies 

**Semester Advantage**: Since the game resets each semester, we can iterate aggressively on features between terms without worrying about backward compatibility. This allows us to ship an MVP quickly and enhance it based on real student feedback each semester.

**Technical Debt Strategy**: Accept technical debt in features (not core engine) during MVP phase. Use semester breaks to refactor and improve based on usage patterns.
